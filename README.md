# Forest-Fire-Prediction-Using-ML
Forest fires results in a danger to lives, properties, and environment. This project proposes a 
system that leverages machine learning to predict forest fire risk and implement mitigation 
strategies. The system will utilize historical data on weather conditions, vegetation, topography, 
and past fire occurrences. By training various machine learning algorithms, the system will 
identify patterns and relationships that contributes to fire risk i.e. temperature, humidity and 
oxygen level. The predicted fire risk will be displayed on a user-friendly interface, allowing 
forest authorities to prioritize resource allocation for prevention and early intervention. The 
successful implementation of this system can significantly reduce the devastating impacts of 
forest fires. This combination of machine learning and web development creates a strong tool for 
early detection and prevention of forest fire by providing better prediction of fire occurrence to 
the forest firefighters and stakeholders. The project is focused on building a web page that ensures the 
accurate prediction of forest fire occurrence. To ensure the model prediction accuracy, there are various 
 testing and training scenarios developed for the dataset so that the prediction accuracy 
will be more accurate and relevance. The outcome of the project is to provide a practical and 
user-friendly prediction model to the forest firefighters and stakeholders so that they can take 
some extra measures to control the fire and prevent the forest form the damage. This project also 
provides a structure for future research and development in this field.
